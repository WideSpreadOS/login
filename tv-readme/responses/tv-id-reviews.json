If you're obsessed with zombie lore and the idea of watching the long-term effects spanning years at a time on an entire cast of characters, then this show is for you. There are a lot of scary parts with zombies eating and the gore and visual effects are award winning, but the show is mostly how people get along with each other during an apocalyptic setting and how they rebuild civilization or just live moment to moment.",

The show deals with love, loss, zombies (called 'walkers' on the show), death, destruction and zombies!\r\nAndrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride and Lauren Cohan are amongst the star studded cast who deliver **OUTSTANDING** performances in every episode. \r\n\r\n_The Walking Dead_ is consistently thrilling and emotionally resonant, with solid character development and enough blood-splattering gore to satisfy anyone! The comic book counterpart has a big influence on the show, so fans of the comic love it too.\r\n\r\nEach season gives enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, while maintaining the back-breaking tension and suspense that keeps audiences watching again and again.\r\n\r\n_The Walking Dead_ puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre, and each season demonstrates why it's one of the best horror shows on television.",

If indeed it ends. Moderately watchable. 6/10 from me.",

It was exactly about zombies, but later (after Governor era) they turned one of my favorite TV shows into cheap, boring action series. It's so prolonged, that it became soap opera. It's time to end this jumbled mess. Please end it already and liberate us from this boredom.",

That isn't the show's fault of course. Due to that, I had to refresh my mind as to what happened between E1/16 and a lot does occur in S10. I enjoyed all of it, I particularly love how gory the show is at times while the look of the walkers continues to impress with each episode. I like the S10 storyline, very intrigued to see how the final season goes.\r\n\r\nNorman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Melissa McBride (Carol) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) remain the pick of the show's cast, but you also have the likes of Samantha Morton (Alpha) and Ryan Hurst (Beta) in there too. Cailey Fleming (Judith) is still remarkable, she acts way beyond her young years. There are a few others who are good too.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's the greatest show ever, but 'The Walking Dead' is my standout show personally. I love it. Bring on S11.",
